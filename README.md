FujiConvert
===========

FujiConvert converts media files to various Atari 8-bit Computer storage media
and playback methods.

FujiConvert is based on client-side HTML5/Javascript/WebAudio running within a
web broswer like Chrome, Mozilla or IE. There is no communication with a
backend server other than to retreive the web page itself.
